[flake8]

1. Ignore the 'venv' directory completely

exclude = venv

2. Set the max line length to 100 (default is 79, which is too short)

max-line-length = 100

3. Ignore these specific "noisy" style errors:

E302: expected 2 blank lines, found 1

W292: no newline at end of file

E122: continuation line missing indentation or outdented

E501: line too long (we set our own max-line-length)

W503: line break before binary operator (this is a common one)

ignore = E302, W292, E122, E501, W503
